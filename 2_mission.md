# Mission

Our unyielding faith on Swamiji's ideals of *Service of mankind is service to
God* is the mantra behind our mission. We, therefore, make it a point to
practice exactly what we believe in so firmly. We consider **Sevabrata** as a
means to reach out selflessly to many desperate & critically ill patients and
do our best to provide timely medical help in all matters be it financial,
logistical, advisory etc.

Inspired by the enduring legacy of **Swami Vivekananda**, our mission is:

- Help provide timely medical advice to poor and needy families in rural and semi-rural India.
- Help organise funds from our members & broader society to be able to provide the much needed financial assistance to the needy and helpless suffering families.
- Provide logistical support in terms of transportation and temporary accommodation to patientâ€™s families during the hospitalization.
- Look after the post-hospitalization financial and wellbeing of the patient.
- Keep regular touchpoints and connects with the patient families lest should there be any further deterioration in the health condition.
