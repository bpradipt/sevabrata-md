# Progress

Since our inception, we have had the privilege of providing support to several
critically ill patients and their families. We firmly believe that we have been
blessed by revered Swamiji to have been able to organise much-needed
logistical, financial, and medical consultation with leading medical
practitioners in Bangalore thus enabling their timely hospitalization. This
gives us immense joy that we have been of service to mankind which is our
mission.

Some of our recent success stories are that of Poltu Bera. Poltu, who hailed
from rural West Bengal, had almost come to believe that he wouldn't live long.
After all, even today, only a minuscule number of Indians donate their organs,
and a far fewer percentage get them on time. Read about others in our Blog on
Prakash Bag, Guddi Devi, Palash Das et al. We are also exploring other services
like supporting remote health treatment.

Sevabrata would provide end to end financial assistance to the patient. As an
organization, the funds in our reserve would be used. And thereafter, through
various campaigns, we would raise money as per the requirement. We endeavour to
provide the following assistance to critically ill patients and their families:

- Raise funds for the treatment of the patients through a global campaign.
- Find appropriate doctors and hospitals for best and economic treatment.
- Provide guidance and logistics support to the patient during the treatment.
- Support post-treatment care up to rehabilitation on case to case basis.
- Provide emotional support in challenging times.
