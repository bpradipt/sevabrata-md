<h1>Who We Are</h1>
<p><strong>Sevabrata</strong> - <em>Dedicated to serve others</em>.</p>
<p>The name and the motto of the organisation entwined. This apolitical
and non-profit social organisation is conceived by a few like-minded
volunteers, who believe in working in the spirit of service as
proclaimed by Swami Vivekananda. Sevabrata aims to extend a helping hand
for all those who look for medical guidance and all the financial
assistance, logistics, and psychological support related to it. The
success of our activities has inspired us to form an organization to be
able to serve all who seek our support in their hours of need.</p>
<p>We understand that there is a huge need for medical assistance in
rural areas of our country. Especially for people who are financially
strained, getting adequate access to medical facilities is at times
difficult, if not impossible. The ignorance of the people also adds to
their woes. The key problem areas related to medical ecosystem in our
country, particularly in rural areas are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The lack of knowledge and guidance.</li>
<li>Ever-increasing medical cost.</li>
<li>Financial insolvency.</li>
<li>Unavailability of critical care in rural areas.</li>
</ul>
<p>While we understand that we cannot hold every hand in need, but
within our possibilities, we have pledged to reach out to people as much
as we can. This selfless endeavour to help people particularly in need
of medical assistance is driven by the urge to give back to society in
our simple ways.</p>
<p><strong>Sevabrata Foundation</strong>, a registered NGO, was born
from the conviction that we should aim to address the huge gap between
demand versus accessibility to high quality critical medical care for
thousands of underprivileged rural and semi-rural families. At
Sevabrata, we are a group of people from diverse backgrounds, and from
all over the world, with a single purpose to help bridge the healthcare
affordability gap for the poor every step of the way.</p>

<h1>Mission</h1>
<p>Our unyielding faith on Swamiji’s ideals of <em>Service of mankind is
service to God</em> is the mantra behind our mission. We, therefore,
make it a point to practice exactly what we believe in so firmly. We
consider <strong>Sevabrata</strong> as a means to reach out selflessly
to many desperate &amp; critically ill patients and do our best to
provide timely medical help in all matters be it financial, logistical,
advisory etc.</p>
<p>Inspired by the enduring legacy of <strong>Swami
Vivekananda</strong>, our mission is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Help provide timely medical advice to poor and needy families in
rural and semi-rural India.</li>
<li>Help organise funds from our members &amp; broader society to be
able to provide the much needed financial assistance to the needy and
helpless suffering families.</li>
<li>Provide logistical support in terms of transportation and temporary
accommodation to patient’s families during the hospitalization.</li>
<li>Look after the post-hospitalization financial and wellbeing of the
patient.</li>
<li>Keep regular touchpoints and connects with the patient families lest
should there be any further deterioration in the health condition.</li>
</ul>

<section id="progress" class="level1">
<h1>Progress</h1>
<p>Since our inception, we have had the privilege of providing support
to several critically ill patients and their families. We firmly believe
that we have been blessed by revered Swamiji to have been able to
organise much-needed logistical, financial, and medical consultation
with leading medical practitioners in Bangalore thus enabling their
timely hospitalization. This gives us immense joy that we have been of
service to mankind which is our mission.</p>
<p>Some of our recent success stories are that of Poltu Bera. Poltu, who
hailed from rural West Bengal, had almost come to believe that he
wouldn’t live long. After all, even today, only a minuscule number of
Indians donate their organs, and a far fewer percentage get them on
time. Read about others in our Blog on Prakash Bag, Guddi Devi, Palash
Das et al. We are also exploring other services like supporting remote
health treatment.</p>
<p>Sevabrata would provide end to end financial assistance to the
patient. As an organization, the funds in our reserve would be used. And
thereafter, through various campaigns, we would raise money as per the
requirement. We endeavour to provide the following assistance to
critically ill patients and their families:</p>
<ul>
<li>Raise funds for the treatment of the patients through a global
campaign.</li>
<li>Find appropriate doctors and hospitals for best and economic
treatment.</li>
<li>Provide guidance and logistics support to the patient during the
treatment.</li>
<li>Support post-treatment care up to rehabilitation on case to case
basis.</li>
<li>Provide emotional support in challenging times.</li>
</ul>

Swamiji by being part of it yourself. We would love to connect with you

society ultimately helps us be better humans. It takes us closer to the
realization of the real meaning of human life is to live for others and
not for one’s own selfish goals.</p>
<p><strong>Sevabrata</strong> is a unique platform to execute service in
an organized manner to implement the philosophy of <em>Be good and do
