# Contributing

This is a unique and enthusiastic beginning of a promising new-born
organization. Support from all corners is solicited to flourish the idea and
see a fully-grown organization within the next few years.

You can help us in our journey on the footsteps of our revered Swamiji by being
part of it yourself. We would love to connect with you and welcome you to our
family. We sincerely believe doing good for society ultimately helps us be
better humans. It takes us closer to the realization of the real meaning of
human life is to live for others and not for one's own selfish goals.

**Sevabrata** is a unique platform to execute service in an organized manner to
implement the philosophy of *Be good and do Good*.

May Swamiji bless us all and help us to realise our goal.
