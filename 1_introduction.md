# Who We Are

**Sevabrata** - *Dedicated to serve others*. 

The name and the motto of the organisation entwined. 
This apolitical and non-profit social organisation is conceived by a few
like-minded volunteers, who believe in working in the spirit of service as
proclaimed by Swami Vivekananda. Sevabrata aims to extend a helping hand for
all those who look for medical guidance and all the financial assistance,
logistics, and psychological support related to it. The success of our
activities has inspired us to form an organization to be able to serve all who
seek our support in their hours of need.

We understand that there is a huge need for medical assistance in rural areas
of our country. Especially for people who are financially strained, getting
adequate access to medical facilities is at times difficult, if not impossible.
The ignorance of the people also adds to their woes. The key problem areas
related to medical ecosystem in our country, particularly in rural areas are:

- The lack of knowledge and guidance.
- Ever-increasing medical cost.
- Financial insolvency.
- Unavailability of critical care in rural areas.

While we understand that we cannot hold every hand in need, but within our
possibilities, we have pledged to reach out to people as much as we can. This
selfless endeavour to help people particularly in need of medical assistance is
driven by the urge to give back to society in our simple ways.

**Sevabrata Foundation**, a registered NGO, was born from the conviction that we
should aim to address the huge gap between demand versus accessibility to high
quality critical medical care for thousands of underprivileged rural and
semi-rural families. At Sevabrata, we are a group of people from diverse
backgrounds, and from all over the world, with a single purpose to help bridge
the healthcare affordability gap for the poor every step of the way.
